# BASIC-CALCULATOR
Create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This project will help you practice your front-end development skills and enhance your understanding of web technologies.<br>
Project Requirements:<br>
User Interface:<br>
● Create a user-friendly interface for the calculator. Design a layout that includes a display for input and results.<br>
● Include buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and operators (+, -, *, /).<br>
● Add special buttons for "Clear" and "Equals."<br><br>
Functionality:<br>
● Implement the core calculator functionality using JavaScript.<br>
● Users should be able to enter numerical values, perform calculations, and see the results on the display.<br><br>
Operations:<br>
● The calculator should be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
● Ensure that the calculator follows the correct order of operations (e.g., BODMAS/BIDMAS).<br><br>
Input Handling:<br>
● Handle user input accurately. Ensure that the calculator responds to button clicks and keyboard input.<br><br>
Error Handling:<br>
● Implement error handling to handle cases like division by zero or other mathematical errors.<br>
