# BASIC-CALCULATOR
Create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This project will help you practice your front-end development skills and enhance your understanding of web technologies.
Project Requirements:
User Interface:
● Create a user-friendly interface for the calculator. Design a layout that includes a
display for input and results.
● Include buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and operators (+, -, *, /).
● Add special buttons for "Clear" and "Equals."
Functionality:
● Implement the core calculator functionality using JavaScript.
● Users should be able to enter numerical values, perform calculations, and see the
results on the display.
Operations:
● The calculator should be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
● Ensure that the calculator follows the correct order of operations (e.g.,
BODMAS/BIDMAS).
Input Handling:
● Handle user input accurately. Ensure that the calculator responds to button clicks
and keyboard input.
Error Handling:
● Implement error handling to handle cases like division by zero or other
mathematical errors.
